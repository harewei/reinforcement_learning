This repository is for reinforcement learning beginners.  

All algorithms are contained entirely inside their own script instead of breaking them
up into individual pieces like many other RL tutorials.  While the latter has the benefit of 
code being more organized and reusable, it is often hard for beginners to navigate when 
they are simply looking to understand the algorithm.
